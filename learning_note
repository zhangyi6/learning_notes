set()可以记录没有重复的数据集

--------------2018.5.2-----------------
i've learned about first chapter of the course called 'data_analysis' 
from Udacity, done some practice of this course, and generally know 
the process of data analysis, that is:
1. observe the frame of the data set, and come up with questions about
  the data, find the abnormal nouns

2. then correct the abnormal nouns

3. make the data visible (use matplotlib.pyplot)
